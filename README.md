# YOLOv8 Custom Object Detection Model

This repository contains the code, dataset, and trained model for a custom object detection task using **YOLOv8**. The goal of this project is to train a YOLOv8 model to detect specific objects from a custom dataset and deploy it for real-time object detection.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to detect [mention the types of objects, e.g., "traffic signs", "fruits", etc.] using a custom YOLOv8 model. The model was trained on a dataset of [mention dataset size and content] and has been fine-tuned for optimal accuracy.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Source**: [Provide details of the dataset source, or whether it's self-collected]
- **Dataset Size**: [e.g., 200 images, with 3 classes]
- **Classes**: [List of object classes]

The dataset is preprocessed into a format suitable for YOLOv8 training (YOLO format with annotation files).

## Model Training

The YOLOv8 model was trained using the following parameters:

- **Model**: YOLOv8 [e.g., YOLOv8n (nano), YOLOv8s (small), etc.]
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Epochs**: [Number of epochs]
- **Batch Size**: [Batch size]
- **Learning Rate**: [Specify learning rate]
- **Optimizer**: [e.g., Adam/SGD]

To replicate the training process:

```bash
!yolo train data=your_data.yaml model=yolov8s.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640
```

## Model Performance

- **Training Accuracy**: [accuracy or mAP on the training set]
- **Validation Accuracy**: [accuracy or mAP on the validation set]
- **Loss**: [Final loss values]
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: [You can add detailed performance metrics here]



```

### Running the Model

To test the model on custom images, run:

```bash
!yolo detect model=best.pt source=your_image.jpg
```

### Inference

You can use the trained model for inference on both images and video streams. Simply replace the `source` parameter with the path to the image or video file.
